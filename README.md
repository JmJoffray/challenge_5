Observation 1
- Based on the Capomulin Scatterplot, we can see that the heavier the mouse is, the larger the tumor will be at the end of treatment. With a correlation coefficient of .84 this observation is reinforced, as a correlation coefficient between 0 and 1 demonstrates a positive relationship between the two variables.

Observation 2
- Based on the line plot for Mouse Id #s185, Capomulin must be taken over time for it to be effective. As seen from the data, the tumor shrunk the most between timepoints 5 and 10, as well as time points 30 and 45.

Observation 3

- Based on the boxplot, Capomulin and Ramicane are the more effective drug at reducing the size of squamous cell carcinomas
